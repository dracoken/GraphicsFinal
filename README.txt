This is was a School group project made by Jacob Shepard and Dyllin Wood, 
it ultilizes some portions of code from a previous lab in the class. 
However, what we did program was rendering the 3d objects that we created in blender, and lastly animation for those rendered objects.



Instructions how to Run Program
1) type "npm i" or "npm install" to install all the dependencies for the project
2) type "node server.js" to run the server
3) go to browser and type "http://localhost:3000/lab10.html"
